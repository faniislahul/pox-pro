    """Compute shortest path lengths and predecessors on shortest paths
    in weighted graphs.

    The algorithm has a running time of $O(mn)$ where $n$ is the number of
    nodes and $m$ is the number of edges.  It is slower than Dijkstra but
    can handle negative edge weights.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
       The algorithm works for all types of graphs, including directed
       graphs and multigraphs.

    source: node label
       Starting node for path

    weight : string or function
       If this is a string, then edge weights will be accessed via the
       edge attribute with this key (that is, the weight of the edge
       joining `u` to `v` will be ``G.edges[u, v][weight]``). If no
       such edge attribute exists, the weight of the edge is assumed to
       be one.

       If this is a function, the weight of an edge is the value
       returned by the function. The function must accept exactly three
       positional arguments: the two endpoints of an edge and the
       dictionary of edge attributes for that edge. The function must
       return a number.

    Returns
    -------
    pred, dist : dictionaries
       Returns two dictionaries keyed by node to predecessor in the
       path and to the distance from the source respectively.
       Warning: If target is specified, the dicts are incomplete as they
       only contain information for the nodes along a path to target.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXUnbounded
       If the (di)graph contains a negative cost (di)cycle, the
       algorithm raises an exception to indicate the presence of the
       negative cost (di)cycle.  Note: any negative weight edge in an
       undirected graph is a negative cost cycle.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import networkx as nx
    >>> G = nx.path_graph(5, create_using = nx.DiGraph())
    >>> pred, dist = nx.bellman_ford_predecessor_and_distance(G, 0)
    >>> sorted(pred.items())
    [(0, [None]), (1, [0]), (2, [1]), (3, [2]), (4, [3])]
    >>> sorted(dist.items())
    [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4)]

    >>> pred, dist = nx.bellman_ford_predecessor_and_distance(G, 0, 1)
    >>> sorted(pred.items())
    [(0, [None]), (1, [0])]
    >>> sorted(dist.items())
    [(0, 0), (1, 1)]

    >>> from nose.tools import assert_raises
    >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(5, create_using = nx.DiGraph())
    >>> G[1][2]['weight'] = -7
    >>> assert_raises(nx.NetworkXUnbounded, \
                      nx.bellman_ford_predecessor_and_distance, G, 0)

    Notes
    -----
    Edge weight attributes must be numerical.
    Distances are calculated as sums of weighted edges traversed.

    The dictionaries returned only have keys for nodes reachable from
    the source.

    In the case where the (di)graph is not connected, if a component
    not containing the source contains a negative cost (di)cycle, it
    will not be detected.
