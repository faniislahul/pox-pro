def johnson(G, weight='weight'):
    r"""Uses Johnson's Algorithm to compute shortest paths.

    Johnson's Algorithm finds a shortest path between each pair of
    nodes in a weighted graph even if negative weights are present.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    weight : string or function
       If this is a string, then edge weights will be accessed via the
       edge attribute with this key (that is, the weight of the edge
       joining `u` to `v` will be ``G.edges[u, v][weight]``). If no
       such edge attribute exists, the weight of the edge is assumed to
       be one.

       If this is a function, the weight of an edge is the value
       returned by the function. The function must accept exactly three
       positional arguments: the two endpoints of an edge and the
       dictionary of edge attributes for that edge. The function must
       return a number.

    Returns
    -------
    distance : dictionary
       Dictionary, keyed by source and target, of shortest paths.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
       If given graph is not weighted.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import networkx as nx
    >>> graph = nx.DiGraph()
    >>> graph.add_weighted_edges_from([('0', '3', 3), ('0', '1', -5),
    ... ('0', '2', 2), ('1', '2', 4), ('2', '3', 1)])
    >>> paths = nx.johnson(graph, weight='weight')
    >>> paths['0']['2']
    ['0', '1', '2']

    Notes
    -----
    Johnson's algorithm is suitable even for graphs with negative weights. It
    works by using the Bellman–Ford algorithm to compute a transformation of
    the input graph that removes all negative weights, allowing Dijkstra's
    algorithm to be used on the transformed graph.

    The time complexity of this algorithm is $O(n^2 \log n + n m)$,
    where $n$ is the number of nodes and $m$ the number of edges in the
    graph. For dense graphs, this may be faster than the Floyd–Warshall
    algorithm.
